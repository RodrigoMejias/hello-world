My mame is Rodrigo Mejias. I am a Physics-Economics dual major presently completing my senior year at Claremont McKenna College.
I am passionately interested in learning novel computational and statistical methods, particularly machine learning.
My main areas of interest are sports statistics, astronomy and space science.
